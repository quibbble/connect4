## Objective 🎯
Be the first to form a line of 4. 

## Components 🧱
- A 7 x 6 game board.
- 42 discs
  - Two Players: 21 🔴 21 🟡
  - Three Players:  14 🔴 14 🟡 14 🟢

## Setting Up 🏗️
1. Place the game board between the two players.
2. Each player selects a color and takes the corresponding discs.
3. Decide who goes first; traditionally, the player with the red discs goes first.

## How to Play 🚀
What to do on your turn:

1. **Drop a Disc:** On your turn, choose one of your discs and drop it into one of the columns on the grid. The disc will fall to the lowest available space within that column.

2. **Check for a Win:** After dropping a disc, check to see if you have formed a line of 4 of your own colored discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If you do, you win the game. 

3. **Continue Play:** If there is no winner yet, it's the next player's turn.

## How to Win 🏆
A player wins by being the first to form a line of 4 of their own colored discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all columns are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
